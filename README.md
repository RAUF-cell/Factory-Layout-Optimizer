## Introduction

In modern manufacturing, the layout of a factory plays a crucial role in determining overall efficiency. Poor layout can lead to increased material handling, wasted time, and ultimately reduced productivity. This repository offers a solution by applying a Genetic Algorithm to optimize the layout of factory elements. 

The Genetic Algorithm mimics natural selection to find the best layout configuration. It evaluates various layouts, selects the most efficient ones, and combines them to create new, potentially better layouts. This iterative process continues until the algorithm finds an optimal solution.

## Features

- **Maximized Production Efficiency**: Focuses on improving throughput by reducing travel distances.
- **Minimized Material Flow Distance**: Optimizes layout to decrease the time and effort needed to move materials.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.
- **Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib to visualize the factory layout and material flow.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can adjust parameters to fit their specific factory needs.

## Technologies Used

This project employs several key technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementing the Genetic Algorithm.
- **Matplotlib**: A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations, used for handling data efficiently.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis, facilitating easier data handling.
- **SciPy**: A library used for scientific and technical computing.

## Installation

To set up the Factory Layout Optimizer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RAUF-cell/Factory-Layout-Optimizer.git
   cd Factory-Layout-Optimizer
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Use pip to install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   After installation, you can start the application by running:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can input the following parameters:

- **Number of Workstations**: Specify how many workstations you have.
- **Distance Matrix**: Provide a matrix that defines the distances between different workstations.
- **Population Size**: Set the number of layouts to evaluate in each generation.
- **Generations**: Define how many generations the algorithm should run.

After entering these parameters, the Genetic Algorithm will start optimizing the layout. The results will display the best layout configuration along with a visualization of the material flow.

## Example

Here's a simple example to demonstrate how to use the application:

1. Start the application as mentioned in the **Installation** section.
2. Enter the following parameters when prompted:
   - Number of Workstations: `5`
   - Distance Matrix:
     ```
     0 2 3 1 4
     2 0 1 2 3
     3 1 0 2 1
     1 2 2 0 3
     4 3 1 3 0
     ```
   - Population Size: `50`
   - Generations: `100`

3. After the algorithm runs, it will display the optimized layout and a plot showing the material flow.
